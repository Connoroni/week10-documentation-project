# Usage
P5 is a installation package for Javascript that allows users to create art while learning code. It is more oridentented towards the creative types that wish to learn code. 

The best way to get started with P5 is to use their online editor, which works similar to codepen, allowing users to preview their code first hand. Howwever there is a NPM package that can be installed using the "npm install p5" command, that will provide the user with the needed package files. 

from there after creating a new js file called "sketch" and linking it to your html file. You can use the
function setup() {
    createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
to set the paramters for your sketch and then begin to create your art within your canvas so to speak

The art is made in .js files called sketches which can contain audio and can be any combination of: 3D, animated, interactive, and generative/randomised

The reference library is similar to what weâ€™ve seen in things like Radix, and explains the different objects and motions we can create with p5
